# Example for ignoring specific directories or files within the project structure
# sniffer_firmware/sniffer-tag/Debug/

# If you use STM32CubeMX generated code, consider these:
# /Middlewares
# /Drivers
# /Inc
# /Src
# Keep the specific files you modify under version control, 
# and ignore the rest generated by CubeMX if you regenerate them frequently.
